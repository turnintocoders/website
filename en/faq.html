		<p><strong>Do we need more developers?</strong><br />
			Yes. To build a website today is (apparently) very easy, but to build a good website, working,
			unique, tailored on the owner and on the users you need a developer. Plus, once you learn
			the basics of JavaScript programming, you can carry on with your skills and the profession.
			Try it yourself: have a look at the job boards and try to find how many programming
			positions are open. Ah! And we would love to train more lady coders.

		<div id="posso-lavorare" class="section-separator"></div>
		<p><strong>Can I work while doing the course?</strong><br />
			In theory not. Not because it's "prohibited", but because your will be very, very busy by the
			course. So you need to have, aside from the money for the fee, something aside to live without
			working for 2-3 months. Remember that we run a bootcamp every 4 months: if you are not ready now,
			write us and let us know when you'll be ready to go.
		</p>

		<div id="inglese" class="section-separator"></div>
		<p><strong>Is the course in English?</strong><br />
			Of course.

		<div id="costo" class="section-separator"></div>
		<p><strong>Why does Turn into Coders cost less than half other bootcamps of the same value?</strong><br />
			Turn into Coders' programme is based on cooperative learning. From the beginning you'll
			become a mentor towards others who know less than you. The study weeks are organised
			to let great freedom and a lot of time to work on project development. We think that this
			is the best way to learn something new. The collateral positive thing on the economic side
			is that it's also cheaper	as we need less mentors and we can keep a lower price, without
			sacrificing training quality.<br>
			Still about cost, don't miss the <a href="#borse-di-studio">scholarships</a>.

		<div id="quota-all-inizio" class="section-separator"></div>
		<p><strong>How do I pay the fee?</strong><br />
			To confirm your application you'll need to pay a deposit of €500.
			To access the discounted prices you need to apply and pay the deposit before the specified
			dates. To pay you'll be contacted via email or phone and you'll receive the invoice with the
			bank transfer details.
		</p>
		<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>

		<div id="candidatura-rifiutata" class="section-separator"></div>
		<p><strong>What happens if my application is rejected?</strong><br />
			If you want to keep studying for the next bootcamp, then no problem.
			Otherwise you will be completely refunded. In any case, before asking for the deposit,
			we check together that you have started working on the prerequisites, in order to minimise
			the risk that this will happen.

		<div id="borse-di-studio" class="section-separator"></div>
		<p><strong>Are there any scholarships?</strong><br />
			We are looking for <a href="/en/companies.html">sponsor companies</a> to get
			scholarships to offer to the best students. We currently have 4 that reduce the cost
			to €500. We are working to cover all the available places.<br>
			The scholarships are awarded when applications close.

		<div id="incontri" class="section-separator"></div>
		<p><strong>Can I join Coding for everyone even if I know that I will not attend the bootcamp?</strong><br />
			Indeed! Coding for everyone is open to everyone! If you like it you can invite
			your friends and spread the word, we don't need anything else.

		<div id="un-po-bravo" class="section-separator"></div>
		<p><strong>I'm already almost good, can I skip the meetings before the course?</strong><br />
			Uhm, not really… We would like to be sure that your future job will be the right choice
			for you, that's why the prerequisites are a series of steps towards learning programming
			skills. You need to do it semi-autonomously, which means that you need to try alone. Since
			it's normal to get stuck, especially at the beginning, you can join our weekly meetups
			<a href="https://www.meetup.com/turn-into-coders/" target="_blank">Coding for everyone</a>.
