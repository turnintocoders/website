			and build projects, everything in 4 groups of 4 people, always in a cooperative way.
		</p>
		<p>
			During the course you'll be exposed to full-stack development in JavaScript, test-driven
			development, relational databases.
			We'll also touch concepts of UX design and project management.

	</section>

	<section>
		<h2>Projects & mentorship</h2>
		<p>
			Once the bootcamp is over you can test yourself developing a project for 4 weeks,
			followed by 8 weeks of mentorship, in which you'll have the opportunity of creating
			your own curriculum building projects, meeting companies or creating your own startup!
		</p>
	</section>

	<div id="prerequisites" class="section-separator cf"></div>
	<section>
		<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
		<p>
			Before attending the bootcamp you need to have followed a path on your own.
			That will be useful also in understanding if you are really interested in becoming
			a web developer and it will allow you to reach a skill level that will be as omogeneous
			as possible with the other students.
		</p>
		<p>
			The prerequisites are:
		</p>
		<ol class="text-block">
			<li>Register on <a href="https://www.github.com" target="_blank">Github</a></li>
			<li>
				Join our chat on <a href="https://gitter.im/turnintocoders/codingforeveryone" target="_blank">Gitter</a>
				and actively participate
			</li>
			<li>
				Register on <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org" target="_blank">FreeCodeCamp</a> and complete the sections:
				<ul>
					<li>HTML5 & CSS</li>
					<li>Basic JavaScript</li>
					<li>Object Oriented and Functional Programming</li>
					<li>Basic Algorithm Scripting</li>
				</ul>
			<li>
				When you are confident enough, build a one page website using
				<a href="https://pages.github.com/" target="_blank">Github pages</a>
			</li>
			<li>
				Register on <a href="https://www.codewars.com" target="_blank">Codewars</a> and, in JavaScript:
				<ul>
					<li>Reach 5th kyu</li>
					<li>
						<a href="https://www.codewars.com/kata/new/javascript" target="_blank">Create one kata</a>
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
			To avoid making the achievements of the prerequisites too frustrating or long, you can
			join us at the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/turn-into-coders/" target="_blank">weekly meetups</a>
			where we can help you finishing them.
		</p>
		<h3>Pre-bootcamp</h3>
		<p>
			You can work alone on the prerequisites or you can join the 4 weeks long pre-bootcamp,
			just before the bootcamp.
		</p>
		<p>
			In the pre-bootcamp we work together on the prerequisites, plus we have workshops, projects
			and peronal work. The pre-bootcamp is just a way to complete the prerequisites. You can do
			that alone, but consider it as a help and a faster, more focused, way to work on the
			prerequisites.
		</p>

		<h3>Pre-bootcamp example week schedule</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Monday: 10-12 workshop, personal study</li>
			<li>Tuesday: 10-12: workshop, project introduction and personal study</li>
			<li>Wednesday: project</li>
			<li>Thursday: project, 15-17: code review</li>
			<li>Friday: project, group presentation of the projects, meeting with companies and externals</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			The rythm is a bit kinder compared to the bootcamp and the path is a bit more indipendent,
			but you can already taste how the following weeks will be like, in full autonomy.
