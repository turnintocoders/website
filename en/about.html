		<h1>About us</h1>

		<p>
			Turn into Coders is a project by <b>Matteo Giaccone</b>, software engineer born and raised in Torino, Italy.
			He studied and worked in Italy, France, Switzerland and United Kingdom. As far as he remembers, he has always
			been keen on understanding and learning technology, together with social issues and respect for people and
			environment. A short time after graduating at Politecnico, he co-founded “weLaika”, a software consultancy
			cooperative still going on today. He then moved to UK to enlarge his visions and improve his web development
			skills. In London he discovered <a href="https://foundersandcoders.com/" target="_blank">Founders&amp;Coders</a>
			and started discussing with them how to export the model to his hometown, Torino.
		</p>

		<p><b>Laura Spina</b> is a friendly jurist, keen on writing, learning&amp;teaching and good at connecting people.</p>

		<p><b>Antonio Trabalza</b> is a neuroscientist, Founders&amp;Coders graduate, Turn into Coders’ mentor.</p>

		<!-- <p>Many people and companies are supporting Turn into Coders’ idea. Here is who they are.</p> -->

		<h2>Why do we do Turn into Coders?</h2>

		<p>
			We work on Turn into Coders because we want more people to work in coding.
			Coding is creative, powerful, useful and a world-wide passport job.
			Of course if you manage to become a computer engineer it's really great for you.
			But it's not the only way to learn how to work in IT in a valuable manner.
			A bootcamp is a high-effort way, in a relatively short time, to turn into a solid coder.
			You will learn how to master JavaScript, and you will be able to go on learning other languages by yourself.

		<h2>Manifesto</h2>

		<ol>
			<li>Code is power, and power must be spread.</li>
			<li>We believe in cooperative learning and working.</li>
			<li>We use any method: the importance is in learning.</li>
			<li>Doesn't matter where you learn. If you know how to do the job, the job is yours.</li>
			<li>We believe in gender equality: to fill the gap, we incentivate women to start and continue coding.</li>
			<li>We believe in power of generosity: that's why we always find time for organizing for-free occasions of learning and sharing.</li>
			<li>We support open-source because it's free and useful.</li>
